# Stock-predictions-using-mlandann
My first attempt at a Machine Learning project.


As I did this in VSCode using python, we will need to first install jupyter notebook extension or an easier alternative is google colaboratory.
Further the Libraries that we will be installing through the command terminal is done like this


pip3 install keras


pip3 install matplotlib


pip3 install numpy


pip3 install pandas


pip3 install sklearn


pip3 install yfinance
The yfinance library is a yahoo financy library from where we will be downloading our stock quote.


Also to divide into cells like in a jupyter notebook I have used '#%%'.
